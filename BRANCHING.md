# Branching and releases

## Branches

| Branch | Role | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | **Stable.** What users build, package and release. | Only release merges from `dev` (or a hotfix PR) land here. CI must be green. |
| `dev` | **Experimental integration.** The next release lives here and may be broken between commits. | Feature/fix PRs target `dev`. CI must be green before merge. |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `security/*` | Short-lived work branches. | Branch from `dev`, PR back to `dev`, delete after merge. |
| `hotfix/*` | Emergency fix for a released version. | Branch from `main`, PR to `main`; only critical/high verified security or a release-blocking regression. |

`main` and `dev` are both protected in spirit: no direct pushes of code, no
force-pushes, CI green before merge. Tagging and release publication are
maintainer actions.

## Release flow

1. **Feature / fix PR** → `dev`. CI runs the same gates as for `main`.
2. **Pre-release**: freeze `dev` and tag a validated `dev` commit
   `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (release candidates only; there is no `-pre.N` channel) and
   push the tag. After `-rc.1` only stabilisation fixes land in `dev`.
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes it as a **GitHub pre-release**
   (GitHub marks it "Pre-release"; package tooling must ignore it unless the
   user opts in).
3. **Stabilisation**: once `dev` is release-ready, merge `dev` → `main` (merge
   commit or fast-forward, no code changes beyond release metadata).
4. **Stable release**: tag the merge commit `vX.Y.Z` on `main`; the release
   workflow publishes a full GitHub release with generated notes and the
   release kernel (`pagh-vX.Y.Z`, built by `cargo build --release --locked` with
   the nightly pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`).
5. **Hotfix**: branch from `main`, PR to `main` with full CI plus a targeted
   regression test, tag a PATCH version **straight to stable** (no RC), then
   merge `main` back into `dev` with `--no-ff`; `dev` keeps the higher version
   and CHANGELOG/AGENTS merge additively.

## Tag conventions

| Tag | Cut from | GitHub release type |
|---|---|---|
| `vX.Y.Z` (or bare `X.Y.Z`, the historical style here) | `main` | Release |
| `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` | `dev` (must not already be on `main`) | Pre-release |

New tags always carry the `v` prefix (`vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`); old bare-numeric
tags stay as history. The version source of truth is the repository's version
file (`Cargo.toml [package].version`; `Cargo.lock` mirrors it and CI builds with
`--locked`); `dev` carries the next release version, `main` the last released
one. The release workflow checks both the tag's branch (stable: main; RC:
dev-only) and that the tag base equals the version source. The operational
checklist is in `RELEASING.md`.

## Why two branches

`main` stays reproducible for users and downstream repositories (whose packaged
kernels point at releases). `dev` lets integration work — multi-repo changes,
experimental features, unfinished migrations — land and be tested continuously
without making `main` unstable.
