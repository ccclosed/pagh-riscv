//! One-shot TLS 1.3 server authentication (issue #14 series) — the decision
//! layer that ties the previous PRs into a single "may I talk to this peer?"
//! answer. Pure `core` + `alloc`, panic-free, self-contained: no kernel
//! services, no RNG, no embedded-tls types. The kernel call site
//! (`net::tls`) adapts the handshake's borrowed certificate entries and the
//! negotiated `SignatureScheme` onto the small own types below, and the host
//! property P49 drives the exact same source with synthetic chains.
//!
//! Three decisions, all fail-closed, all mandatory, in this order:
//!
//!   1. **Chain** — [`tls_chain::verify_chain`] links the server's
//!      certificates to the configured trust anchors (byte-equal names, every
//!      signature verified, `cA=TRUE` on every issuer, validity windows plus
//!      the 2025 clock gate against the caller-provided `now`).
//!   2. **Hostname** — RFC 6125 authorization of the connection target
//!      against the LEAF's SAN entries only: dNSName entries through
//!      [`hostname::hostname_matches`] for a DNS target, iPAddress entries
//!      through [`hostname::ip_matches`] for an IP-literal target. There is
//!      deliberately NO CommonName fallback (CN matching was deprecated by
//!      CA/B Forum in 2017; every current mirror certificate carries SAN) and
//!      NO cross-type matching (an IP host never matches a dNSName entry and
//!      vice versa). A missing or malformed SAN extension is a reject, not a
//!      pass; a missing host (`None`) is a reject too — a verifier without a
//!      name to check has nothing to authorize.
//!   3. **Leaf key export** — the TLS 1.3 `CertificateVerify` message (a
//!      signature over the handshake transcript, sent AFTER the certificate)
//!      must be checked with the LEAF's public key. [`authenticate_server`]
//!      copies the leaf SPKI into an owned [`LeafKey`]; a leaf whose
//!      algorithm is outside the supported surface fails the handshake here
//!      rather than at the signature step (same fail-closed surface as
//!      [`super::x509::SpkiKey::Unsupported`]).
//!
//! The `CertificateVerify` check itself lives here too:
//! [`certificate_verify_message`] builds the exact signed message
//! (RFC 8446 §4.4.3: 64 spaces + context string + transcript hash) and
//! [`verify_certificate_verify`] dispatches on the negotiated
//! [`Tls13Scheme`]. Unlike the X.509 chain signatures — where RSA-PSS is
//! rejected outright (parameters-driven OID, see `tls_verify` module docs) —
//! TLS 1.3 REQUIRES RSA `CertificateVerify` signatures to be PSS
//! (`rsa_pss_rsae_*`, RFC 8446 §4.2.3): the scheme is fully determined by the
//! negotiated identifier (hash = suffix, salt length = hash length, trailer
//! fixed), so there is no parameter surface to downgrade. A chain signed
//! PKCS1-v1_5 with an RSA leaf therefore verifies its chain in PKCS1-v1_5 and
//! its `CertificateVerify` in PSS — that combination is what real Debian
//! mirrors serve.
//!
//! ## The two hashes of RFC 8446 §4.4.3
//!
//! The transcript hash in that message comes from the negotiated CIPHER SUITE
//! (`Aes128GcmSha256` ⇒ SHA-256 ⇒ 32 bytes on this path), while the signature
//! scheme only selects the digest the peer signs with. The two are NOT the same
//! width in general — and RFC 8446 deliberately allows that:
//! `ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384` means "a SHA-384 digest *of* the 32-byte transcript
//! hash". [`verify_certificate_verify`] therefore takes the suite's hash length
//! as an explicit parameter and gates the transcript hash on it alone; it never
//! compares that hash against the scheme's digest width. Doing so was the bug:
//! every P-384 / RSA-PSS-384 / RSA-PSS-512 leaf was refused as if its signature
//! were bad, and three of the module's backends were unreachable.
