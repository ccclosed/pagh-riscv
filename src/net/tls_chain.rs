//! Trust anchors + certificate chain building for the TLS server verifier
//! (issue #14 series) — pure `core` + `alloc`, panic-free, self-contained.
//!
//! This module turns the primitives of the previous PRs into a complete
//! path-validation decision for one server chain:
//!
//!   * [`TrustAnchor`] — a self-signed root the kernel is configured to trust,
//!     as a raw DER `Name` (byte-compared, never parsed) plus its public key;
//!   * [`verify_chain`] — builds leaf → intermediates → anchor by **byte
//!     equality** of `issuer`/`subject` DER names, checks every signature with
//!     [`super::tls_verify::verify_certificate_signature`], enforces
//!     `basicConstraints cA=TRUE` on every issuer (intermediates and roots),
//!     checks each certificate's validity window against the caller-provided
//!     `now`, and applies the **clock gate** below.
//!
//! Fail-closed rules (issue #14 is exactly about removing fail-open paths):
//!
//!   * **Clock gate**: a `now` below [`CLOCK_FLOOR`] (2025-01-01T00:00:00Z) is
//!     a hard [`ChainError::Clock`] reject. At boot the CMOS RTC may be unset
//!     (counting from 1970), and "I do not know what time it is" must refuse
//!     the handshake, never pass it: every real-world certificate on a current
//!     mirror is already inside 2025+, so treating pre-2025 clocks as unset is
//!     safe and eliminates the whole class of "RTC not set ⇒ everything
//!     validates" fail-open windows.
//!   * A chain that never reaches an anchor is a reject ([`ChainError::NoAnchor`]
//!     when nothing matches the issuer name at all); a name match whose
//!     signature does not verify is [`ChainError::Verify`] — never a pass.
//!   * Intermediate/root certificates without `basicConstraints cA=TRUE` are
//!     rejected ([`ChainError::NotCa`]) — RFC 5280 §4.2.1.9: DER omits the
//!     defaulted `FALSE`, so a *missing* extension is also a reject here.
//!   * Extra certificates in the DER after a complete path is found are
//!     ignored (RFC 8446 §4.4.2 lets servers send entries the client does not
//!     need); they are never trusted for anything, so ignoring them removes no
//!     check.
//!
//! No kernel services, no RNG, no host calls: `now` is a parameter, so the
//! kernel call site (`net::tls`, through `tls_auth::authenticate_server`) passes
//! `rtc::now_unix() as i64` and the host property test P47 drives the exact same
//! code with synthetic values.
