"""Generate src/net/ca_bundle.rs - the kernel's TLS trust-anchor bundle.

The TLS verifier authenticates server chains against a fixed set of trusted
self-signed roots. The generated file is COMMITTED to the repo; re-run this
script only to deliberately refresh it.

Ported from the x86-64 sibling. The RISC-V bundle adds the two SSL.com 2022
roots on top of the x86 set: example.com is served through
SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022 (leaf -> Cloudflare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3 ->
SSL.com TLS Transit ECC CA R2 -> anchor), so the port's live HTTPS proof
cannot verify without them. The pins below are the same "select by sha256,
cross-check the CN, require self-signed" policy as the rest of the list.

TRUST MODEL — the download is NOT trusted on its own:
  * every root is PINNED by its sha256 in SELECTION below (verified by hand
    against the operator's own independent copy at pinning time);
  * the script selects each root BY THE PINNED HASH, then cross-checks the
    subject CN inside the pinned DER against the expected CN — a substituted
    or re-issued certificate fails the run instead of silently entering the
    kernel's trust base;
  * only SELF-SIGNED certificates (issuer == subject) are eligible; if a CN
    collision appears in the source (historically: cross-signed variants of
    GTS roots share a subject CN), the self-signed copy is chosen, and
    ambiguity that survives the filter is a hard error — never a silent pick.

Determinism: no timestamps, fixed selection order and formatting. The script
writes the raw module and then runs `rustfmt` over it — the committed
artifact is the output of THIS pipeline (generate + rustfmt), so a plain
regeneration must be byte-identical to what is committed.
